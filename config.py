def build_prompt(description: str, language: str, architecture: str):
    return f"""You are a {language} project structure generator.

Your task is to generate a clean and readable **folder and file structure** for a {language} project based on a short description I will provide.
For generate this structure you must use {architecture} architecure.

ðŸ“Œ Output format:
- Only respond with a valid JSON object â€” no explanation.
- Follow this structure style exactly:
{{
  "root_folder_name": [
    {{"subfolder1": ["subsub1", "subsub2"]}},
    {{"subfolder2": ["file1.py", "file2.py"]}},
    "main"
  ]
}}

ðŸ”§ Guidelines:
- Use common Python project folder names: app, core, routes, services, utils, tests, config, assets, manager, data etc.
- Subfolders can include files or other folders as needed.
- If there are any root-level files like `main`, `run`, include them at the top level of the JSON.

Now, generate the structure for this Python project:
\"{description}\"
